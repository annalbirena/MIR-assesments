## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Initial HTML structure:
    - A form with the following fields:
        - Text field to enter the name of the contact.
    - Button to add the contact.
        - An empty list where the created contacts will be shown.
- Functionalities that the application must have:
    - Add Contacts:
        - When the user enters a name in the text field and clicks the “Add” button, the contact should appear in the list.
        - Each contact in the list should have an Edit button and a Delete button.
    - Delete Contacts:
        - Clicking the “Delete” button next to a contact should remove the contact from the list.
    - Edit Contacts:
        - Clicking the “Edit” button should make the contact name editable. By clicking on a “Save” button (which should replace the “Edit” button), the contact should be updated in the list with the new name.
